1. User Features

Users can register or log in to browse a list of available doctors by specialization.

They can book appointments and make secure online payments through Razorpay.

Users can view both upcoming and past appointments.

The "My Profile" section allows users to update their personal information.

Doctors can complete or cancel appointments directly from their dashboard.

3. Admin Features

The Admin can log in to manage the overall system.

The Admin Dashboard displays the total number of doctors, patients, and booked appointments.
